    "explanation": "The war was over. The MEK's armed campaign had been defeated years earlier. The Tudeh was dismantled in 1983.

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Before 1997, many believed the system could evolve toward accountability. Khatami's eight years destroyed that illusion: every structural reform was blocked by unelected institutions designed for exactly that purpose.

      "A": "Because Iranians are inherently unable to trust any authority",

      "A": "That Khatami was personally incompetent and lacked political skill",

      "A": "Because zealots are always more numerous than opportunists",
      "B": "Because zealots have more military training",
      "C": "Because they are sincere  -  they genuinely believe revolutionary purity demands the elimination of impurity, and they define impurity as broadly as their fervor requires; sincerity without proportionality, due process, and accountability makes them liberators who become criminals",
      "D": "Because zealots receive more foreign support"
    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Sincere zealots are more dangerous than cynics precisely because their sincerity feels like legitimacy. They genuinely believe their moral certainty justifies any action, defining 'impurity' as broadly as their fervor requires. But sincerity is not a license  -  right intention is only one of six criteria, and the person who kills without proportionality or due process is a criminal regardless of sincerity.",

    "options": {
      "A": "That all perpetrators of apartheid crimes should be criminally prosecuted",

    },

Instead, it offered amnesty in exchange for complete truth-telling: perpetrators who disclosed fully received amnesty; those who did not remained subject to prosecution.

      "A": "Because opposition movements always have more time and resources for education than governments do",
      "B": "Because the character of a revolutionary movement predicts the character of the government it produces  -  internally authoritarian movements produce authoritarian governments, and movements that suppress dissent within their ranks do not suddenly embrace pluralism after victory",

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The character of the movement determines the character of the government. Movements that are internally authoritarian, that suppress dissent, and that treat compromise as treachery will create political cultures of mutual suspicion after victory.

    },
    "correct": "B",

    "question": "Why does the lecture argue that the most effective propaganda is built from true facts?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Because lies are illegal under international law",
      "B": "Because using real evidence to construct a false understanding is harder to detect and more persuasive than outright fabrication",

      "D": "Because audiences only respond to verifiable information"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The lecture uses the example of IR state media reporting real footage of American homelessness  -  every fact is true, but the selective arrangement constructs the false understanding that Western democracies are failed systems. This is propaganda at its most effective because each individual element withstands fact-checking.",

    "options": {
      "A": "Because education makes people more gullible",
      "B": "Because propaganda targets the fast, intuitive, emotional system that operates below conscious deliberation  -  educated people have better tools for rationalizing beliefs formed emotionally",
      "C": "Because educated people watch more television",
      "D": "Because propaganda only targets uneducated people"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Propaganda targets the fast emotional system, not the slow analytical system. Educated people are in some ways more vulnerable because they can construct more sophisticated rationalizations for conclusions they reached emotionally  -  a powerful engine running without a steering mechanism.",

    "explanation": "The regime faces a legitimacy gap it cannot close through performance (too much corruption/incompetence) or through genuine elections (which would remove it).

      "A": "It represents proportionate punishment of regime criminals",

    "options": {
      "A": "The national government should handle all legal matters directly",

    "explanation": "Subsidiarity -- deciding things at the lowest level capable of deciding them well -- is the organizing principle of every functioning federal system. Darius established imperial law for multi-provincial and military matters while preserving local law for internal affairs.

      "D": "Because foreign powers alone caused his downfall"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The lecture identifies a structural principle: reform that simultaneously threatens every established interest group creates a unified opposition while the beneficiaries are dispersed and unable to provide political support. Amir Kabir operated within an absolute monarchy with no institutional checks on royal power -- his authority derived entirely from the shah's favor, and when that favor was withdrawn, he had no recourse.",

    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "The lecture argues the Islamist resurgence was a consequence of Ataturk's approach, not a deviation from it. He did not merely separate religion from the state -- he subordinated religion to the state through the Diyanet (Directorate of Religious Affairs). Official Islam became thin and bureaucratic; authentic expression went underground. When liberalization occurred, suppressed religious identity surged back like a compressed spring.",

      "D": "Because all institutions are equally corrupt"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The argument that corruption is part of any nation's cultural DNA is refuted by Singapore's transformation: deeply corrupt in the 1950s, it became one of the least corrupt societies through institutional redesign (CPIB, competitive civil service salaries, zero-tolerance enforcement).

    "options": {
      "A": "Because discontent automatically leads to revolution given enough time",

    "options": {
      "A": "Because it gave the Communist Party a mandate to govern",

      "A": "Because democratic forces are always weaker than the regime",

      "D": "D. Because immigration laws changed three times creating different entry patterns"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Each wave carried different people with different resources and different relationships to Iran: the first wave (1978-1985) was the revolutionary elite, the second wave (1985-2000) was professionals who could not adapt, and the third wave (2000-present) is driven by economic desperation and generational frustration.",

    "explanation": "In every major transition studied  -  South Africa, German reunification, Eastern Europe, the Balkans  -  diaspora return rates have been remarkably consistent at 5-10%.

      "A": "It is the standard timeline recommended by the United Nations for all transitions",

      "D": "International donors require this timeline to release funding"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The 18-24 month window is the comparative evidence's 'Goldilocks zone': long enough for political party formation, voter registration, institutional preparation, and genuine elections; short enough to prevent the transitional government from developing its own interests in perpetuation.",

    "options": {
      "A": "The IRGC might refuse to participate in the transition at all",
      "B": "Like SCAF in Egypt, the IRGC has institutional economic interests and a self-image as guardian of the national order, creating the risk that any transitional body dominated by IRGC elements would manage the transition to protect its own position rather than enable genuine democracy",

      "D": "The IRGC would automatically support democratic transition"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "SCAF was not a neutral caretaker but an interested party that manipulated Egypt's transition to protect its economic empire and political autonomy. The IRGC, with its estimated 25-40% control of Iran's economy and its self-image as guardian of the system, poses an analogous risk.",

      "A": "Industrial water use is the primary driver, and reform is easy because only a few factories need to change",
      "B": "Agriculture accounts for approximately 90% of Iran's water consumption through flood irrigation and water-inappropriate crops, but reform is politically explosive because approximately 4 million farming households depend on current practices for survival",

    "explanation": "Agriculture uses approximately 90% of Iran's water through inefficient flood irrigation and inappropriate crops (rice in arid provinces, sugar cane in desert regions).

    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Modern scholars debate whether Alexander's burning of Persepolis was premeditated or spontaneous, but most agree it was ideologically significant -- the deliberate destruction of the symbolic heart of the empire he was claiming, regardless of the specific circumstances.",

    "options": {
      "A": "That nuclear weapons would benefit Iran's security",
      "B": "That any deal with the Islamic Republic is inherently flawed because the regime's institutional structure prevents genuine compliance, as the nuclear program's strategic ambiguity serves the IRGC's institutional interests regardless of formal agreements",
      "C": "That the deal was perfectly designed and needed no modifications",
      "D": "That only military action can prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The structuralist position argues that the Islamic Republic's institutional design -- particularly the IRGC's control of strategic programs and the Supreme Leader's authority to override any agreement -- makes genuine compliance structurally impossible. The nuclear program's strategic ambiguity serves institutional interests that persist regardless of formal agreements.",

      "A": "Humor is always a safety valve that ultimately serves the regime",
      "B": "Humor always leads directly to revolutionary action",

It releases pressure that might otherwise build toward confrontation, but it also preserves critical consciousness, maintains community solidarity, and articulates truths about power that cannot be spoken directly -- making it a multifunctional survival mechanism.",

    "options": {
      "A": "Because Iran will never experience a transition",
      "B": "Because if the regime collapses suddenly (as in Romania), media liberalization occurs overnight regardless of preference, making pre-transition institutional planning essential so that regulatory frameworks, media governance designs, and technical plans can be deployed rapidly",

    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "Maghbouleh showed that Iranian-origin respondents are uniquely prone to fragmented self-classification -- some marking 'white,' others 'Middle Eastern,' others declining to answer.

    "options": {
      "A": "Northern populations were ethnically distinct from other Iranians and therefore inherently more resistant to change",

    "options": {
      "A": "Iranian women refused to learn Arabic, forcing their husbands to adopt Persian customs entirely",
      "B": "Islamic law gave mothers sole custody of children, ensuring Iranian cultural dominance in the household",
      "C": "Arab husbands were legally required to adopt their wives' cultural practices under Sassanid family law",
      "D": "Children raised by Iranian mothers often spoke Persian as their first language and absorbed Iranian cultural values, effectively Iranianizing subsequent generations that were formally Arab by patrilineal descent"
    },
    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "Savant (2013) documents that children of mixed unions, raised by Iranian mothers, often spoke Persian as their first language and absorbed Iranian customs and values, even though they were formally identified as Arab by patrilineal descent. This maternal cultural influence effectively Iranianized the Arab elite in the eastern provinces over generations, creating vectors of cultural transmission within the formally Arab community.",

    "question": "Oleg Grabar (1973) demonstrates that early Islamic architecture in Iran drew heavily on Sassanid models (the iwan, the dome, the garden). What broader principle of cultural survival does this architectural continuity illustrate?",
    "options": {
      "A": "That the Arab conquerors were incapable of any original cultural production",
      "B": "That conquest typically destroys all traces of the conquered civilization's material culture",
      "C": "That the persistence of artisans, builders, and design traditions enabled elements of the conquered civilization to be incorporated into and transformed within the conqueror's cultural framework",
      "D": "That Islamic law specifically required the preservation of all pre-Islamic architectural forms"
    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Grabar's analysis demonstrates that the continuity was not merely formal but reflected the persistence of the artisans, builders, and design traditions that had produced Sassanid architecture. This illustrates the broader principle that cultural elements embedded in practical knowledge and everyday production are more resilient than those dependent on institutional support, because they cannot be eliminated without eliminating the skilled population itself.",

    "options": {
      "A": "It explicitly drew on Zoroastrian themes of light and darkness and identified its philosophy with the wisdom of ancient Iranian sages ('Khosrowani' wisdom)",

    "options": {
      "A": "That Persian Sufism is entirely an Arab creation with no Iranian cultural influence whatsoever",
      "B": "That there is deep continuity between Zoroastrian spiritual concepts (luminous divinity, the soul's journey, the spiritual guide) and Persian Sufi mysticism, though other scholars find the evidentiary links tenuous",

    "explanation": "Corbin argues for deep continuity, identifying themes including the luminous nature of the divine, the journey of the soul through stages of enlightenment, and the concept of a spiritual guide that he traces from Zoroastrian tradition through Islamic philosophy and Sufism.

    "question": "George Makdisi (1981) traces the madrasa educational institution from its Iranian origins, particularly the Nizamiyya madrasas founded by the Iranian vizier Nizam al-Mulk. This institutional innovation eventually influenced the development of European universities. What does this trajectory illustrate about the Iranian transformation of Islam?",
    "options": {
      "A": "That the madrasa was an Arab invention that Iranians merely copied without modification",

      "D": "That Iranian influence was limited to decorative arts and had no impact on institutional development"
    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "The madrasa example illustrates that Iran's transformation of Islam extended to institutional innovations with worldwide consequences. Iranians did not merely survive within the Islamic framework -- they created institutions that became standard features of Islamic civilization and, through their influence on European institutions, contributed to the development of the Western university system. This represents a particularly consequential dimension of the Iranian reshaping of the conqueror's cultural framework.",

    },
    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "The lecture identifies Egypt's critical deficiency as the absence of an accessible literary codification of its civilizational memory (pharaonic heritage was encoded in hieroglyphics already inaccessible to most Egyptians), combined with the lack of institutional mediators comparable to the dihqan class and less favorable geographic-demographic conditions (compact territory, dense Arab settlement, proximity to Arabia).

      "A": "It uses scientific terminology from Islamic optics to create visual metaphors",
      "B": "It applies mathematical patterns to determine the metrical structure of each couplet",
      "C": "It encrypts political messages using a substitution cipher based on Persian numerology",
      "D": "It deliberately employs words carrying two or more equally valid meanings, creating poems that exist in multiple interpretive states simultaneously without resolving into any single reading"
    },
    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "Hafez deploys iham (amphiboly) with extraordinary frequency and skill, using words that carry multiple equally valid meanings. This creates what scholars describe as 'quantum' poetics, where the poem exists in multiple interpretive states simultaneously, with each reading collapsing certain possibilities while opening others. This is a deliberate literary strategy, not vagueness.",

    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Saadi's lines are inscribed at the UN headquarters in New York.

    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Katouzian identifies key principles in Saadi's ethics (compassion, justice, contentment, education, practical wisdom) but notes they are not absolute rules. They are guides applied with sensitivity to context. Goodman places Saadi in a tradition of 'practical humanism' that is contextual, anti-dogmatic, and expressed through concrete stories rather than abstract argumentation.",

    "options": {
      "A": "An anachronistic projection of modern political concepts onto a standard Mesopotamian royal inscription that followed well-established conventions of ancient Near Eastern royal ideology",
      "B": "The Cyrus Cylinder was a proven forgery created in the nineteenth century",
      "C": "Cyrus the Great never actually conquered Babylon, making the Cylinder's claims historically false",
      "D": "The Cylinder was written in a language that had not yet been deciphered, making its content unknowable"
    },
    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Kuhrt argues the Cyrus Cylinder is a standard Mesopotamian royal inscription in which a conquering king justifies his seizure of power and describes his beneficent policies, following well-established conventions. Characterizing it as a 'declaration of human rights' involves significant anachronistic projection of modern political concepts onto an ancient text produced within a very different conceptual framework, though Cyrus's policies of religious tolerance were genuinely remarkable for the period.",

    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Ansari argues that by constructing a national identity privileging the pre-Islamic past over the Islamic present, the Pahlavi regime alienated the clerical establishment and the traditionally religious majority. The Shah's claim of descent from Cyrus struck many Iranians as blasphemous, substituting a cult of monarchy for religious values. This created a cultural cleavage as politically consequential as economic and political grievances, providing the Islamic opposition with a powerful grievance.",

This failure of perception, the inability to see oneself as others see you, was a characteristic pathology of power that the celebration demonstrated in its most spectacular Pahlavi manifestation.",

Beginning in October 1978, it effectively shut down Iran's oil production by November, depriving the regime of its primary revenue source and principal instrument of international economic leverage.

A constitutional monarchy genuinely sharing power, a security establishment respecting legal limits, an economy distributing oil wealth more equitably, and cultural policy respecting Islamic heritage -- any of these might have altered the trajectory sufficiently.

    "explanation": "Parsa's key insight was that SAVAK could penetrate student organizations, leftist cells, and factory organizers, but the mosque's simultaneous religious and political function made it impossible to shut down without provoking mass backlash, and difficult for SAVAK agents to distinguish genuine religious observance from political organizing. This asymmetry of organizational resilience made the mosque the default coordination mechanism for all groups.",

Its Zoroastrian resonances and affirmation of renewal and joy constitute a cultural statement that implicitly challenges the claim that Iranian identity is primarily Islamic.

They created a culture where indirection became habitual, trust between strangers was structurally difficult, and institutional development was constrained. As Milani (2011) noted, the legacy of dissimulation may impede the transition to open political forms because the prerequisites for democratic deliberation — honest exchange, clearly stated positions, trust that interlocutors mean what they say — are precisely what the survival mechanisms undermined.",

The result: effective micro-level functioning within families but poor macro-level functioning in governance, economy, and civic life.",

    "explanation": "Mahdavy argued in the 1970s that states deriving revenue from external rents (primarily oil royalties) develop fundamentally different political economies from tax-dependent states, facing reduced incentives to build effective bureaucracies, efficient taxation, or responsive governance because they do not depend on citizens' productive activity for revenue -- a prediction largely borne out in the Iranian case.",

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Levitsky and Way identify ruling coalition cohesion, coercive capacity, and degree of Western linkage as the three key dimensions. Iran's ruling coalition (centered on the IRGC) remains cohesive, its coercive apparatus is formidable, and its Western linkage is exceptionally low -- a configuration that, in their framework, predicts 'stable authoritarianism.'",

    "options": {
      "A": "The protests fell far short of the threshold, explaining their failure",
      "B": "The protests likely exceeded the threshold in absolute numbers, but the regime's willingness to use lethal force and the opposition's organizational deficit prevented the sustained pressure needed for success",

    "explanation": "The lecture notes that the 2022 protests likely exceeded Chenoweth's 3.5 percent participation threshold in absolute numbers. However, success also requires sustained pressure over time. The regime's demonstrated willingness to kill on a massive scale (as in 2019) and the opposition's organizational deficit prevented the sustained coordinated pressure that Chenoweth's research identifies as necessary for nonviolent campaign success.",

    "question": "Hannah Arendt, in 'On Revolution' (1963), drew a distinction between two phases of revolution. According to the lecture's application of her framework, why did Iran's 1979 revolution succeed at the first phase but fail at the second?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Because the liberation phase required military force that exhausted the coalition's resources before founding could begin",
      "B": "Because the revolutionary coalition had no shared political philosophy for institutional founding, allowing one faction with a coherent political theology to capture the state, replicating the pattern Arendt identified in the French Revolution",

      "D": "Because the founding phase was disrupted by external military intervention from Iraq before institutions could be established"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Arendt distinguished liberation (overthrowing the old regime) from founding (establishing new institutions). The lecture argues that Iran's 1979 revolution fits this pattern precisely: the broad coalition succeeded at liberation but failed at founding because Islamists, liberals, leftists, and nationalists had 'fundamentally different conceptions of legitimate authority.' Abrahamian (1982) documented how the absence of shared philosophical foundations made the coalition's fragmentation structurally predictable.",

      "A": "It empowered individual moral reasoning by establishing God's justice as the standard for evaluating human laws",
      "B": "It delegitimized independent moral reasoning because if moral truth is accessible only through revelation and its authorized interpretation, then individual attempts at rational moral inquiry are rebellion against divine authority",
      "C": "It had no practical consequences because the debate was purely theoretical",
      "D": "It strengthened the Mu'tazilite tradition by provoking a rationalist counter-movement"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The Ash'arite triumph delegitimized independent moral reasoning. If moral truth is accessible only through revelation and authorized interpretation, then independent rational moral inquiry is not merely error but rebellion against divine authority. The space for philosophical ethics was drastically narrowed, with moral inquiry replaced by moral jurisprudence (fiqh).",

    "options": {
      "A": "That fiqh successfully integrated Aristotelian virtue ethics with Islamic theology",
      "B": "That the increasingly technical character of fiqh progressively displaced broader ethical inquiry, with the jurist (faqih) replacing the philosopher (faylasuf) as the authoritative voice, reducing moral reasoning to classification (wajib, mustahabb, mubah, makruh, haram) rather than discernment",

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Hallaq traced how fiqh's increasing technicality progressively displaced broader ethical inquiry. The jurist replaced the philosopher as moral authority, and the five-fold classification (obligatory, recommended, permissible, disapproved, forbidden) became the primary framework for moral evaluation. This is poorly suited to cultivating moral judgment in the Aristotelian or Zoroastrian sense, reducing reasoning to classification rather than discernment.",

    "options": {
      "A": "The Zoroastrian duty is merely symbolic, requiring only private prayer against injustice",

    "explanation": "The Zoroastrian obligation to oppose druj is not merely 'do not lie' or 'do not harm' but a positive obligation to resist falsehood and destruction wherever encountered. The ashavan who witnesses injustice and remains silent has failed morally, because silence permits druj to advance.

      "A": "The Persian tradition treats freedom and justice as identical concepts with no distinction",

    "explanation": "The Zoroastrian framework holds that because humans freely choose between asha and druj, they bear full responsibility for cosmic consequences. Each good choice advances truth; each bad choice strengthens falsehood.

The solution was a strong presidency insulated from day-to-day parliamentary politics.",

      "A": "Both relied on foreign military intervention to impose institutional change on their respective populations",

The Meiji leaders used the imperial institution's symbolic authority to present modernization as the emperor's will, overriding conservative opposition. De Gaulle invoked the grandeur of France as a historical civilization with a unique vocation. In both cases, the appeal to tradition served transformative purposes, enabling radical change by embedding it within narratives of national continuity.",

      "B": "Rentier states inevitably experience revolution because oil wealth creates hyperinflation that destroys the middle class",

    },
    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "The rentier state concept identifies a structural duality: external revenue sources reduce the regime's dependence on its population (and thus its responsiveness), but make its fiscal position highly vulnerable to external shocks beyond its control. When oil revenue collapses, the rentier state cannot easily shift to tax-based revenue because it lacks the administrative infrastructure and faces population resistance.

When his tenure is perceived as ending (due to term limits, illness, age, or political weakness), subordinates begin hedging toward potential successors.

    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "Geddes distinguishes military, single-party, and personalist regimes, arguing each has distinctive elite dynamics. Personalist regimes are most brittle because power is concentrated in a single leader who stands above institutions. Appointments depend on personal loyalty, and the leader's survival is synonymous with the regime's survival. When personal authority weakens, the institutional structures cannot manage a transition because they were never autonomous. The Islamic Republic's growing personalist dimension under Khamenei makes this analysis increasingly relevant.",

    "explanation": "Riker's size principle holds that rational actors form minimum winning coalitions, just large enough to prevail but no larger, because additional members dilute the spoils. In the revolutionary context, this creates competing incentives: leaders need breadth during the pre-revolutionary phase but want narrowness during the post-revolutionary phase. Khomeini perfectly illustrated this by welcoming liberals, leftists, and nationalists during the revolution and then systematically excluding them afterward, narrowing the coalition until only the clerical faction remained.",

Their convergence required specific bridging figures (like Shariati), trigger events (the Ettela'at article, Jaleh Square), and strategic decisions by faction leaders.

      "A": "Poland had Western military support while Egypt did not, suggesting Iran needs a foreign military patron",
      "B": "Poland's decade of underground organizational development gave Solidarity institutional maturity to negotiate effectively when the moment arrived, while Egypt's lack of sustained coalition-building meant the military filled the organizational vacuum, implying that pre-crisis preparation is the most important determinant of post-transition outcomes",

    "explanation": "The lecture contrasts these cases to illustrate a key principle. Solidarity spent 1981-1989 developing organizational infrastructure, building internal consensus, and preparing institutional blueprints, giving it the maturity to negotiate effectively at the Round Table. Egypt's opposition had no comparable organizational preparation, so when the revolutionary moment arrived, no organized civilian force could compete with the military's institutional dominance.

    },
    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "Kuran's theory explains that in authoritarian societies, pervasive preference falsification creates a systematic divergence between public expression and private beliefs. The regime appears more popular than it is because people conceal their true views. Each individual knows they oppose the regime but cannot know how many others feel the same. This 'preference falsification trap' means support can erode steadily without visible change until a trigger reveals the true distribution of preferences and initiates a self-reinforcing cascade. The threshold distribution is private, making the timing of collapse inherently unpredictable.",

A uniformly distributed population cascades completely, while a bimodally distributed one stalls.

    "explanation": "The lecture identifies the core tension: Iran's extensive human rights record (1988 prison massacres, systematic torture, the 2019 killing of ~1,500 protesters) creates a morally compelling demand for accountability. But the prospect of prosecution gives IRGC commanders a powerful incentive to fight to the end rather than accept transition, since they face imprisonment or worse.

      "A": "It operated as a powerful constraint that created a shared determination to avoid repeating polarization and violence, making compromise appear as wisdom rather than weakness",
      "B": "It was largely irrelevant because most political actors were too young to remember the conflict",
      "C": "It motivated the left to seek retribution against Franquist officials for wartime atrocities",

      "A": "Each crisis weakened both the regime and the opposition equally, resulting in a permanent stalemate that could only be broken by Soviet intervention",

      "B": "That popular referendums are the most effective mechanism for resolving questions of national self-determination during transitions",

    },
    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Geddes (1999) argues that the type of authoritarian regime is a more important predictor of transition dynamics than the mode of transition. Military regimes are more likely to negotiate their exit because officers can return to barracks with institutional prerogatives intact, while personalist regimes are more likely to collapse violently because the ruler has no institutional base to fall back on. Single-party regimes fall between these poles.",

    "explanation": "The comparative evidence shows that Spain, Portugal, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other successful cases benefited enormously from the prospect of EU membership, which created powerful incentives for democratic consolidation by linking economic benefits to political conditions.

      "A": "All institutional reforms should be implemented simultaneously within the first month to prevent authoritarian forces from regrouping",

    "options": {
      "A": "Iran lost 5 cubic kilometers, which is easily replaceable through desalination",
      "B": "Iran lost 100 cubic kilometers but this was offset by dam construction",
      "C": "Iran gained 10 cubic kilometers of water storage due to increased rainfall",
      "D": "Iran lost approximately 25 cubic kilometers, representing irreversible depletion because deep aquifers compacted through overdraft cannot be refilled even if extraction ceases"
    },
    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "GRACE satellite measurements show Iran lost approximately 25 cubic kilometers of water storage between 2002 and 2015. The irreversibility is critical: unlike surface water replenished by precipitation, deep aquifers compacted through overdraft cannot be refilled, meaning every year of delayed reform results in permanent loss.",

      "A": "It cannot be transcended because it is an essential, permanent cultural trait of Iranian civilization",

      "A": "Mutual toleration (accepting opponents as legitimate rivals) and institutional forbearance (refraining from using the full extent of legal powers when doing so would undermine democratic spirit)",
      "B": "Economic growth and military strength",
      "C": "Free trade agreements and international alliance memberships",
      "D": "A written constitution and an independent press"

    "options": {
      "A": "Orban staged a military coup and suspended the constitution in a single dramatic action",
      "B": "Orban used his two-thirds majority to rewrite the constitution, pack the court, capture the electoral commission, control media, and alter electoral rules -- each step technically legal, with no single step sufficient to provoke resistance, but cumulatively transforming the system",
      "C": "Hungary experienced backsliding because it never held democratic elections",
      "D": "Orban was appointed by a foreign power and never won a democratic election"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Scheppele documents how Orban used formally legal mechanisms: rewriting the constitution, lowering judicial retirement age to create vacancies for loyalists, capturing the electoral commission, redirecting state advertising to allied media, and altering electoral rules. Each step was technically legal and none provoked sufficient resistance, but the cumulative effect was the transformation of a democracy into what Orban himself calls 'illiberal democracy.'",

Drawing on Ginsburg and Huq's concept of 'constitutional insurance' and the lecture's analysis of Iran-specific risks, what institutional design approach would best mitigate this threat?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Allow the IRGC to retain its economic empire and political influence as long as it formally accepts the new constitution",
      "B": "Simultaneously dismantle the IRGC's economic-political complex while embedding protections in the constitutional framework: dispersed judicial appointment power, constitutional rigidity, media pluralism protections, and robust civil society legal safeguards",

      "D": "Ignore the IRGC entirely and focus only on writing a constitution"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Ginsburg and Huq's 'constitutional insurance' concept requires protecting the ability of future majorities to contest and replace governments. The lecture identifies the IRGC as Iran's most significant spoiler risk and recommends simultaneous IRGC reform combined with layered constitutional protections: dispersed appointment power, rigid constitutional safeguards, media pluralism, and civil society protections that make capture of multiple institutions simultaneously difficult.",

      "A": "Diaspora professionals have no useful connections to global networks and can only contribute through financial remittances",

    "explanation": "Saxenian documents how diaspora professionals from India, China, and Taiwan served as bridges to global innovation networks by translating between institutional cultures.

    "explanation": "Hirsch's postmemory concept describes how traumatic experiences of one generation are transmitted to subsequent generations through stories, images, and behaviors so powerfully that they constitute memories in their own right.
